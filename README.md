# pHelperPlugin for TurboHUD!

## This is heavy WIP and might still contain bugs!

## Definitions

This helper uses a plugin based definition type system. To add definition types check existing examples in `skills/definitions`. Classes which inherit from `AbstractDefinition.cs` will automatically be added to the UI.

## Hotkeys / AutoActions

Works the same way as definitions. Inherit from `hotkeys/actions/AbstractHotkeyAction.cs` or `autoactions/actions/AbstractAutoAction.cs`.
